# This project is a simple simulation of a coffee shop order system. It consists of three main classes: Customer, Coffee, and Order.

# Installation
To install the coffee_shop project, you can use pip:
pip install coffee_shop

# Usage
# Here is an example of how to use the classes in the coffee_shop project:
from customer import Customer
from coffee import Coffee
from order import Order

# Create a customer
customer = Customer("Jay")

# Create a coffee
coffee = Coffee("Cappuccino", 3.5)

# Create an order
order = Order(customer, coffee, 3.5)

# Access order properties
print(order.customer)  # Output: <Customer: Jay>
print(order.coffee)    # Output: <Coffee: Cappuccino>
print(order.price)     # Output: 3.5

# Access all orders
all_orders = Order.all_orders()
print(all_orders)  # Output: [<Order: Jay's Cappuccino>, <Order: JaneDoe's Latte>]
